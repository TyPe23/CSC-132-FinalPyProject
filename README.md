# Welcome to FinalPi

FinalPi is a bullet-hell style game where you take place as a mech flying through the streets shooting down enemies.

FinalPi was made as an end-of-course college freshman project in Louisiana Tech's Living With Cyber Program and was written by Joshua Bailey, Ty Pederson, and Kennedy Ford.

## Future Plans

In addition to fleshing out this page a bit futhur as things move on, we plan to update and make further improvements to FinalPi moving forward, at least through summer 2020.

### Planned Improvements

1. Options menu 
  - adjusst volume of effects and music
  - change bullet colors (player and enemy)
2. Beastiary
  - showcase of the various enemies with descriptions
3. Levels

  - more enemies, including bosses
